# Authorization

The Cerby API uses [API and bearer tokens](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/9450922-explore-the-api-and-bearer-tokens) to authorize requests. You can only generate and retrieve tokens from the Cerby web app after authenticating into your corporate identity provider, such as Okta or Entra ID, to access your workspace. 

API tokens must be included in the **`X-API-Key`** header of each API request, whereas bearer tokens must be in the **`Authorization`** header.

When performing a request, the Cerby API first tries to authorize it via the API token; if it is not present, authorization is via a bearer token. If none of these tokens are present, the Cerby API returns a **`401`** error.

> **IMPORTANT:** Your tokens are sensitive resources because they grant access to the data you have saved in your workspace. Avoid sharing them in public repositories or client-side code.
