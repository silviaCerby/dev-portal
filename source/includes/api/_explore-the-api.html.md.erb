# Explore the Cerby API

This article describes the capabilities of the Cerby API for 
retrieving user and account data and managing users from app 
integrations.

Cerby has built a public application programming interface (API) 
that enables you to retrieve information about workspace users and 
accounts stored in the Cerby platform. Also, you can perform user 
management actions for software-as-a-service (SaaS) and paid 
social apps connected to a [Cerby App integration](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/6831152-explore-apps) 
(formerly known as tenants), such as inviting and removing users, 
updating roles, and checking for available roles.

The Cerby API follows RESTful principles and the 
[OpenAPI 3.0 Specifications](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html), 
and communicates over HTTPS for secure data transmission. 

To authorize your requests, you must provide an API or bearer token 
that can only be generated and retrieved from the Cerby web app 
after authenticating into your corporate identity provider, such as 
Okta or Entra ID. Based on Cerbyâ€™s role-based access control (RBAC) 
system, this token determines the endpoints and data you can access 
depending on your workspace and item role.

The Cerby API supports the following HTTP request methods:

* GET requests to the following endpoints to retrieve information 
about the accounts stored in the Cerby platform:
    * `/v1/accounts`
    * `/v1/accounts/{id}`
* GET requests to the following endpoints to retrieve information 
about the members of a Cerby workspace and the accounts they have 
access to:
    * `/v1/admin/users`
    * `/v1/users/{id}/accounts`
* GET requests to the following endpoint to retrieve the available 
roles for a SaaS or paid social app connected to a Cerby App 
integration or for a specific asset:
    * `external/v1/tenants/{id}/info`
POST requests to the following endpoints to start the automated 
tasks to invite or remove users of a SaaS or paid social app 
connected to a Cerby App integration and update their role:
    * `/external/v1/tenants/{id}/invite`
    * `/external/v1/tenants/{id}/revoke`
    * `/external/v1/tenants/{id}/update`

# Authorization
All requests to the Cerby API must be authorized using a valid API 
token generated via the Cerby web app or a bearer token. API tokens 
must be included in the **X-API-Key** header of each API request, whereas 
bearer tokens must be in the **Authorization** header. 

When performing a request, the Cerby API first tries to authorize it 
via the API token. If the API token is not present, authorization 
is via a bearer token. If none of these tokens are present, the 
Cerby API returns a 401 error.

For more information on how to generate and retrieve a token, read the 
articles [Generate an API]() token and [Retrieve a bearer token]().
