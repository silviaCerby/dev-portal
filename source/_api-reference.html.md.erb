# API reference

Cerby has built a public API that enables you to retrieve the following data from your workspace in JSON-encoded responses:

* [Accounts](accounts.html)
* [Users](users.html)
* [Business hubs](business-hubs.html)

The Cerby API follows RESTful principles and the [OpenAPI 3.0 Specifications](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html), and communicates over HTTPS for secure data transmission. 

Based on Cerby's role-based access control (RBAC) system, the API or bearer token you use for authentication determines the endpoints and data you can access depending on your workspace and item role. 

The base URL is the following: **`https://my-workspace.cerby.io/api/v1/`**. You must replace **`my-workspace`** with the name of your workspace.
