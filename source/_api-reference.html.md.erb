# Cerby developer portal

Cerby is an identity, access, and password management 
platform for disconnected applications that don’t 
support common identity and security standards. 
This developer portal contains self-serve tools 
you can use to seamlessly integrate our services 
into your applications and systems.

# API reference

Cerby has built a public API that enables you to retrieve the following data from your workspace in JSON-encoded responses:

* [Accounts](#accounts)
* [Users](#users)
* [Jobs](#jobs)
* [Secrets](#secrets)
* [Tenants](#tenants)
* [Teams](#teams)
* [Collections](#collections)

The Cerby API follows RESTful principles and the 
[OpenAPI 3.0 Specifications](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html) 
and communicates over HTTPS for secure data transmission. 

Based on Cerby’s role-based access control (RBAC) system, the **`X-API-Key`** 
API key you use for authentication determines the endpoints and data you can 
access depending on your workspace and item role. 
Learn more about the Cerby API authentication and how to generate the 
API key in the [Authentication](#authentication) section.

The base URL is the following: 
**'https://my-workspace.cerby.com/api/v1/'**. 
You must replace **'my-workspace'** with the name of your workspace.
