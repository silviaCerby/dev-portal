# Users

In Cerby, users are individuals who have access to a workspace and can create, protect, 
and manage items. A user object contains information about the user name, email, 
workspace role, and other relevant attributes within the context of your workspace.

A user object is created in Cerby when you perform any of the following actions:

* Provision a user in Cerby from your corporate identity provider (IdP), such as Okta
or Entra ID (formerly Azure AD).
* Invite a user to join a local user workspace, with an identity managed by Cerby.
* Invite a user to join a workspace as a guest user, with an identity managed by Cerby.

With the Cerby API, you can retrieve all users or specific users by providing their ID. 

> **IMPORTANT:** You can only retrieve users if you have the workspace **Admin**, **Super Admin**, 
or **Owner** role. Your permissions are determined by your API or bearer token, based on 
Cerbyâ€™s RBAC system.
